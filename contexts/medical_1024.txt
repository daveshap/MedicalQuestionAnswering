Closed Reduction - 1, PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Right distal both-bone forearm fracture.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Right distal both-bone forearm fracture.,INDICATIONS:, Mr. ABC is a 10-year-old boy who suffered a fall resulting in a right distal both-bone forearm fracture. Upon evaluation by Orthopedic Surgery team in the emergency department, it was determined that a closed reduction under conscious sedation and application of a splint was warranted. This was discussed with the parents who expressed verbal and written consent.,PROCEDURE:, Conscious sedation was achieved via propofol via the emergency department staff. Afterwards, traction with re-creation of the injury pattern was utilized to achieve reduction of the patient's fracture. This was confirmed with image intensifier. Subsequently, the patient was placed into a splint. The patient was aroused from conscious sedation and at this time it was noted that he had full sensation throughout radial, median, and ulnar nerve distributions and positive extensor pollicis longus, flexor pollicis longus, dorsal and palmar interossei.,DISPOSITION: ,Post-reduction x-rays revealed good alignment in the AP x-rays. The lateral x-rays also revealed adequate reduction. At this time, we will allow the patient to be discharged home and have him follow up with Dr. XYZ in one week.surgery, closed reduction, distal both bone forearm, emergency department, pollicis longus, bone forearm, forearm fracture, conscious sedation, emergency, department, pollicis, longus, splint, distal, bone, forearm, conscious, sedation, fracture, reduction,
