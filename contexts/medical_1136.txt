Bronchoscopy - Fiberoptic, HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, A 67-year-old gentleman who presented to the emergency room with chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and recent 30-pound weight loss. He had a CT scan done of the chest there which demonstrated bilateral hilar adenopathy with extension to the subcarinal space as well as a large 6-cm right hilar mass, consistent with a primary lung carcinoma. There was also a question of liver metastases at that time.,OPERATION PERFORMED:, Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsies.,The bronchoscope was passed into the airway and it was noted that there was a large, friable tumor blocking the bronchus intermedius on the right. The tumor extended into the carina, involving the lingula and the left upper lobe, appearing malignant. Approximately 15 biopsies were taken of the tumor.,Attention was then directed at the left upper lobe and lingula. Epinephrine had already been instilled and multiple biopsies were taken of the lingula and the left upper lobe and placed in a separate container for histologic review. Approximately eight biopsies were taken of the left upper lobe.surgery, endobronchial, intermedius, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, lung carcinoma, bronchoscopy, fiberoptic, chest, tumor, lobeNOTE
