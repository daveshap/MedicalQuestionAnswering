Nephrolithiasis - Progress Note, SUBJECTIVE:, The patient returns today for a followup. She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis. This was all treated. She did require a stent in the left ureter. Dr. XYZ took care of this. She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy. She is now back here for followup. I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet. I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F. Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost. Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it. She has no followup appointment with Dr. F. The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc. Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled. She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take. She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again. She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like. She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.
