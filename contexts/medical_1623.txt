Intraarterial Particulate Administration, EXAM:, Therapy intraarterial particulate administration.,HISTORY:, Hepatocellular carcinoma.,TECHNIQUE:, The patient was brought to the interventional radiology suite where catheterization of the right hepatic artery was performed. The patient had previously given oral and written consent to the radioembolization procedure. After confirmation of proper positioning of the hepatic artery catheter, 3.78 GBq of yttrium-90 TheraSphere microspheres were infused through the catheter under strict radiation safety procedures.,FINDINGS:, There were no apparent complications. Using data on tumor burden, right lobe liver volume, vascularity of the tumor obtained from angiography and quantitative CT, and measurement of residual activity tumor, the expected radiation dose to the tumor burden in the right lobe of the liver was calculated at 201 Gy. The expected dose to the remaining right liver parenchyma is 30 Gy.,Following the procedure there was no evidence of radioactive contamination of the room, equipment or personnel.,IMPRESSION:, Radioembolization therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma in the right lobe of the liver using 3.78 GBq of yttrium-90 microspheres TheraSphere.radiology, lobe of the liver, intraarterial particulate administration, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic artery, tumor burden, particulate administration, hepatocellular, carcinoma, hepatic, artery, radioembolization, therasphere, microspheres, radiation, gy, therapy, particulate, administration, catheterization, tumor, liver, intraarterial,
