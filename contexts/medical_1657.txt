Echocardiogram - 2, EXAM:, Echocardiogram.,INDICATION:, Aortic stenosis.,INTERPRETATION:, Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed of adequate technical quality. Left ventricle reveals concentric hypertrophy with normal size and dimensions and normal function. Ejection fraction is 60% without any obvious wall motion abnormality. Left atrium and right side chambers are of normal size and dimensions. Aortic root has normal diameter.,Mitral and tricuspid valves are structurally normal except for minimal annular calcification. Valvular leaflet excursion is adequate. Aortic valve reveals annular calcification. Fibrocalcific valve leaflets with decreased excursion. Atrial and ventricular septum are intact. Pericardium is intact without any effusion. No obvious intracardiac mass or thrombi noted.,Doppler reveals mild mitral regurgitation, mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Estimated pulmonary pressure of 48. Systolic consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary hypertension. Peak velocity across the aortic valve is 3.0 with a peak gradient of 37, mean gradient of 19, valve area calculated at 1.1 sq. cm consistent with moderate aortic stenosis.,IN SUMMARY:,1. Concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with normal function.,2. Doppler study as above, most pronounced being moderate aortic stenosis, valve area of 1.1 sq. cm.radiology, moderate aortic stenosis, annular calcification, concentric hypertrophy, aortic stenosis, echocardiogram, stenosis, valve, aortic,
