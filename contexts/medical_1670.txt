CT Scan of Abdomen & Pelvis with Contrast, EXAM:, CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast.,REASON FOR EXAM:, Abdominal pain.,COMPARISON EXAM:, None.,TECHNIQUE:, Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained. 5-mm slices were acquired after injection of 125 cc of Omnipaque IV. In addition, oral ReadiCAT was given. Reformatted sagittal and coronal images were obtained.,DISCUSSION:, There are numerous subcentimeter nodules seen within the lung bases. The largest measures up to 6 mm. No hiatal hernia is identified. Consider chest CT for further evaluation of the pulmonary nodules. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are within normal limits. No dilated loops of bowel.

No suspicious osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions.,IMPRESSION:,1. Postoperative changes seen within the pelvis without appreciable evidence for free fluid.,2. Numerous subcentimeter nodules seen within the lung bases. Consider chest CT for further characterization.radiology, ct scan, abdominal pain, multiple axial images, abdomen and pelvis, adrenal glands, chest ct, coronal, gallbladder, kidneys, liver, lymphadenopathy, nodules, osteoblastic, osteolytic, pancreas, sagittal, spleen, with contrast, free fluid, ct, abdomen, pelvis,
