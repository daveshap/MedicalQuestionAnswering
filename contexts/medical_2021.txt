Trigger Finger Release, PROCEDURE:, Trigger finger release.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A longitudinal incision was made over the digit's A1 pulley. Dissection was carried down to the flexor sheath with care taken to identify and protect the neurovascular bundles. The sheath was opened under direct vision with a scalpel, and then a scissor was used to release it under direct vision from the proximal extent of the A1 pulley to just proximal to the proximal digital crease. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.,The tendons were identified and atraumatically pulled to ensure that no triggering remained. The patient then actively moved the digit, and no triggering was noted.,After irrigating out the wound with copious amounts of sterile saline, the skin was closed with 5-0 nylon simple interrupted sutures.,The wound was dressed and the patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.orthopedic, a1 pulley, neurovascular bundles, trigger finger release, proximal digital, digital crease, trigger finger, trigger, finger, sheath, incision
