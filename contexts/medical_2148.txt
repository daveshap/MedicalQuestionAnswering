MRI Elbow - 1, FINDINGS:,There is severe tendinitis of the common extensor tendon origin with diffuse intratendinous inflammation (coronal T2 image #1452, sagittal T2 image #1672). There is irregularity of the deep surface of the tendon consistent with mild fraying (#1422 and 1484) however there is no distinct tear.,There is a joint effusion of the radiocapitellar articulation with mild fluid distention.,The radial collateral (proper) ligament remains intact. There is periligamentous inflammation of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament (coronal T2 image #1484) of the radial collateral ligamentous complex. There is no articular erosion or osteochondral defect with no intra-articular loose body.,There is minimal inflammation of the subcutis adipose space extending along the origin of the common flexor tendon (axial T2 image #1324). The common flexor tendon otherwise is normal.,There is minimal periligamentous inflammation of the anterior band of the ulnar collateral ligament (coronal T2 image #1516, axial T2 image #1452) with an intrinsically normal ligament.,The ulnotrochlear articulation is normal.,The brachialis and biceps tendons are normal with a normal triceps tendon. The anterior, posterior, medial and lateral muscular compartments are normal.,The radial, median and ulnar nerves are normal with no apparent ulnar neuritis.,IMPRESSION:,Lateral epicondylitis with severe tendinitis of the common extensor tendon origin and minimal deep surface fraying, without a discrete tendon tear.,Periligamentous inflammation of the radial collateral ligamentous complex as described above with intrinsically normal ligaments.,Small joint effusion of the radiocapitellar articulation with no osteochondral defect or intra-articular loose body.,Mild peritendinous inflammation of the subcutis adipose space adjacent to the common flexor tendon origin with an intrinsically normal tendon.,Minimal periligamentous inflammation of the anterior band of the ulnar collateral ligament with an intrinsically normal ligament.orthopedic, radial collateral ligamentous complex, intra articular loose body, axial t image, ulnar collateral ligament, common flexor tendon, mri elbow, ligamentous complex, radial collateral, ulnar collateral, collateral ligament, flexor tendon, periligamentous inflammation, mri, tendon
