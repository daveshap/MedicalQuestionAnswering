Radioactive Plaque - Insertion, PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Macular edema, right eye.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ,Macular edema, right eye.,TITLE OF OPERATION:, Insertion of radioactive plaque, right eye with lateral canthotomy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual manner for a local eye procedure. Initially, a 5 cc retrobulbar injection of 2% Xylocaine was done. Then, a lid speculum was inserted and the conjunctiva was incised 4 mm posterior to the limbus. A 2-0 silk traction suture was placed around the insertion of the lateral rectus muscle and, with gentle traction, the temporal one-half of the globe was exposed. The plaque was positioned on the scleral surface immediately behind the macula and secured with two sutures of 5-0 Dacron. The placement was confirmed with indirect ophthalmoscopy. Next, the eye was irrigated with Neosporin and the conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain catgut. The intraocular pressure was found to be within normal limits. An eye patch was applied and the patient was sent to the Recovery Room in good condition. A lateral canthotomy had been done.ophthalmology, canthotomy, ophthalmoscopy, radioactive plaque, scleral surface, macular edema, lateral canthotomy, macular
