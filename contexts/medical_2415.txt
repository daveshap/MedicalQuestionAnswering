Optometry - Letter, RE: Sample Patient,Dear Dr. Sample:,Sample Patient was seen at the Vision Rehabilitation Institute on Month DD, YYYY. She is an 87-year-old woman with a history of macular degeneration, who admits to having PDT therapy within the last year. She would like to get started with some vision therapy so that she may be able to perform her everyday household chores, as well as reading small print. At this time, she uses a small handheld magnifier, which is providing her with only limited help.,A complete refractive work-up was performed today, in which we found a mild change in her distance correction, which allowed her the ability to see 20/70 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left eye. With a pair of +4 reading glasses, she was able to read 0.5M print quite nicely. I have loaned her a pair of +4 reading glasses at this time and we have started her with fine-detailed reading. She will return to our office in a matter of two weeks and we will make a better determination on what near reading glasses to prescribe for her. I think that she is an excellent candidate for low vision help. I am sure that we can be of great help to her in the near future.,Thank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient.,With best regards,,Sample Doctor, O.D.ophthalmology, optometry, letter, optometry letter, pdt therapy, distance correction, macular degeneration, reading glasses, vision therapy, complete refractive, macular, degeneration,
