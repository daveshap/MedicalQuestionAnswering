Ultrasound OB, REASON FOR EXAM:, Followup for fetal growth., ,INTERPRETATION:, Real-time exam demonstrates a single intrauterine fetus in cephalic presentation with a regular cardiac rate of 147 beats per minute documented. ,FETAL BIOMETRY: ,BPD = 8.3 cm = 33 weeks, 4 days,HC = 30.2 cm = 33 weeks, 4 days,AC = 27.9 cm = 32 weeks, 0 days,FL = 6.4 cm = 33 weeks, 1 day,The head to abdomen circumference ratio is normal at 1.08, and the femur length to abdomen circumference ratio is normal at 23.0%. Estimated fetal weight is 2,001 grams. ,The amniotic fluid volume appears normal, and the calculated index is normal for the age at 13.7 cm. ,A detailed fetal anatomic exam was not performed at this setting, this being a limited exam for growth. The placenta is posterofundal and grade 2., ,IMPRESSION:, Single viable intrauterine pregnancy in cephalic presentation with a composite gestational age of 32 weeks, 5 days, plus or minus 17 days, giving and estimated date of confinement of 8/04/05. There has been normal progression of fetal growth compared to the two prior exams of 2/11/05 and 4/04/05. The examination of 4/04/05 questioned an echogenic focus within the left ventricle. The current examination does not demonstrate any significant persistent echogenic focus involving the left ventricle.obstetrics / gynecology, amniotic fluid volume, placenta, posterofundal, intrauterine pregnancy, followup for fetal growth, ultrasound ob, cephalic presentation, abdomen circumference, circumference ratio, echogenic focus, fetal growth, fetal,
