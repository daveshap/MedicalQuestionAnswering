BIMANUAL: Reveals significant cervical motion tenderness and fundal tenderness. She had no tenderness in her adnexa. There are no palpable masses.,A:, Although unlikely based on the patient's exam and pain, I have to consider subclinical pelvic inflammatory disease. GC and chlamydia was sent and I treated her prophylactically with Rocephin 250 mg and azithromycin 1000 mg. Repeat biopsies were not performed based on her colposcopy as well as her previous Pap and colposcopy by Dr. A. A LEEP is a reasonable approach even in this 16-year-old.,P:, We will schedule LEEP in the near future. Even though she has already been exposed HPV Gardasil would still be beneficial in this patient to help prevent recurrence of low-grade lesions as well as high-grade lesions. Now, we have her given her first shot.obstetrics / gynecology, gravida, ecc, external genitalia, hpv, leep, pap, acetowhite, biopsies, blood with urination, cervical os, colposcopy, intraepithelial, right lower quadrant, squamous, suspicious, vaginal discharge, low grade pap, low grade,
