The endocervical canal was then progressively dilated with Hanks and Hegar dilators to a #10 Hegar. The ACMI hysteroscope was then introduced into the uterine cavity using sterile saline solution as a distending media and with attached video camera. The endometrial cavity was distended with fluids and the cavity visualized. Multiple irregular areas of fibroid degeneration were noted throughout the cavity. The coronal areas were visualized bilaterally with corresponding tubal ostia. A moderate amount of proliferative appearing endometrium was noted. There were no direct intraluminal lesions seen.
