VP Shunt Placement, TITLE OF OPERATION:, Placement of right new ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts Strata valve and to removal of right frontal Ommaya reservoir.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY:, The patient is a 2-month-old infant, born premature with intraventricular hemorrhage and Ommaya reservoir recommendation for removal and replacement with a new VP shunt.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:, Hydrocephalus.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:, Hydrocephalus.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:, The patient was brought to the operating room, underwent induction of general endotracheal airway, positioned supine, head turned towards left. The right side prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Next, using a 15 blade scalpel, two incisions were made, one in the parietooccipital region and. The second just lateral to the umbilicus. Once this was clear, the Bactiseal catheter was then tunneled. This was connected to a Strata valve. The Strata valve was programmed to a setting of 1.01 and this was ensured. The small burr hole was then created. The area was then coagulated. Once this was completed, new Bactiseal catheter was then inserted. It was connected to the Strata valve. There was good distal flow. The distal end was then inserted into the peritoneal region via trocar. Once this was insured, all the wounds were irrigated copiously and closed with 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Caprosyn as well as Indermil glue. The right frontal incision was then opened. The Ommaya reservoir identified and removed. The wound was then also closed with an inverted 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Caprosyn. Once all the wounds were completed, dry sterile dressings were applied. The patient was then transported back to the ICU in stable condition intubated. Blood loss minimal. All sponge and needle counts were correct.neurosurgery, ommaya reservoir, frontal, strata valve, intraventricular hemorrhage, vp shunt, ventriculoperitoneal, hydrocephalus,
