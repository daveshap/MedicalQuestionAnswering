MRI Cervical Spine - 2, EXAM:,MRI SPINAL CORD CERVICAL WITHOUT CONTRAST,CLINICAL:,Right arm pain, numbness and tingling.,FINDINGS:,Vertebral alignment and bone marrow signal characteristics are unremarkable. The C2-3 and C3-4 disk levels appear unremarkable.,At C4-5, broad based disk/osteophyte contacts the ventral surface of the spinal cord and may mildly indent the cord contour. A discrete cord signal abnormality is not identified. There may also be some narrowing of the neuroforamina at this level.,At C5-6, central disk-osteophyte contacts and mildly impresses on the ventral cord contour. Distinct neuroforaminal narrowing is not evident.,At C6-7, mild diffuse disk-osteophyte impresses on the ventral thecal sac and contacts the ventral cord surface. Distinct cord compression is not evident. There may be mild narrowing of the neuroforamina at his level.,A specific abnormality is not identified at the C7-T1 level.,IMPRESSION:,Disk/osteophyte at C4-5 through C6-7 with contact and may mildly indent the ventral cord contour at these levels. Some possible neuroforaminal narrowing is also noted at levels as stated above.neurology, mri cervical spine, ventral cord contour, cervical spine, spinal cord, cord contour, ventral cord, mri, narrowing, ventral, cord
