Right ulnar sensory response 2.1, amplitude 1, distance 90.,3. Left median sensory response 3.0, amplitude 1.2, distance 100.,4. Left median motor response distal 4.2, proximal 9, amplitude 2.2, distance 290, velocity 60.4 m/sec.,5. Right median motor response distal 4.3, proximal 9.7, amplitude 2, and velocity 53.7 m/sec.,6. Right ulnar motor response distal 2.5, proximal 7.5, amplitude 2, distance 300, velocity 60 m/sec.,NEEDLE EMG TESTING,1. ,RIGHT BICEPS:, Fibrillations 0, fasciculations occasional, positive waves 0. Motor units, increased needle insertional activity and mild decreased number of motor units firing.,2. ,RIGHT TRICEPS:, Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations occasional to 1+, positive waves 1+. Motor units, increased needle insertional activity and decreased number of motor units firing.,3. ,EXTENSOR DIGITORUM:, Fibrillations 0, fasciculations rare, positive waves 0, motor units probably normal.,4. ,FIRST DORSAL INTEROSSEOUS:, Fibrillations 2+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 2+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing.,5. ,RIGHT ABDUCTOR POLLICIS BREVIS:, Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 0. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing.,6., FLEXOR CARPI ULNARIS:, Fibrillations 1+, occasionally entrained, fasciculations rare, positive waves 1+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing.,7. ,LEFT FIRST DORSAL INTEROSSEOUS:, Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves occasional. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing.,8. ,LEFT EXTENSOR DIGITORUM:, Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing.,9. ,RIGHT VASTUS MEDIALIS:, Fibrillations 1+ to 2+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 1+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing.,10. ,ANTERIOR TIBIALIS:, Fibrillations 2+, occasionally entrained, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 1+.
