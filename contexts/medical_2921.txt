CT Head - 2, REASON FOR CT SCAN:, The patient is a 79-year-old man with adult hydrocephalus who was found to have large bilateral effusions on a CT scan performed on January 16, 2008. I changed the shunt setting from 1.5 to 2.0 on February 12, 2008 and his family obtained this repeat CT scan to determine whether his subdural effusions were improving.,CT scan from 03/11/2008 demonstrates frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 2.6 cm. The 3rd ventricular contour which is flat with a 3rd ventricular span of 10 mm. There is a single shunt, which enters on the right occipital side and ends in the left lateral ventricle. He has symmetric bilateral subdurals that are less than 1 cm in breadth each, which is a reduction from the report from January 16, 2008, which states that he had a subdural hygroma, maximum size 1.3 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left.,ASSESSMENT:, The patient's subdural effusions are still noticeable, but they are improving at the setting of 2.0.,PLAN:, I would like to see the patient with a new head CT in about three months, at which time we can decide whether 2.0 is the appropriate setting for him to remain at or whether we can consider changing the shunt setting.neurology, ct scan, subdural, adult hydrocephalus, bilateral effusions, shunt setting, subdural effusions, hydrocephalus, ventricular, scan, ct,
