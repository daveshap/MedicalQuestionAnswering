This patient is admitted to the hospital for treatment of a febrile illness. There is concern that she has a progression of pneumonia. She may have aspirated.

Therefore, clindamycin is the appropriate antibiotic for possible aspiration.,2. Intractable diarrhea. The patient has been experiencing intractable diarrhea. I am concerned about Clostridium difficile infection with possible pseudomembranous colitis. I will send her stool for Clostridium difficile toxin assay. I will consider treating with metronidazole.,3. Hypokalemia. The patient's profound hypokalemia is likely secondary to her diarrhea. I will treat her with supplemental potassium.,4.
