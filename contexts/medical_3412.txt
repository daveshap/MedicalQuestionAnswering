Follow up blood pressure were some of them were in the 125 to 70 range making us think her hypertension as labile and perhaps related to the excitement of the admission.,She seem quite happy and in no distress at the time of discharge. We will follow up in the office and try to further evaluate her for the unexplained weight loss. She has been taking the Adderall for at least a year, and the mother does not think the Adderall is the cause of the weight loss. The free T4 is borderline high and probably bears repeating along with further studies for Graves disease as an outpatient.general medicine, gastroenteritis, autism, constipation, hyperactivity, blood pressure, weight loss, adderall
