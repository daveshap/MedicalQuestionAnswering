Laparoscopic Appendectomy - 3, PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Appendicitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Appendicitis. ,PROCEDURE:, Laparoscopic appendectomy. ,ANESTHESIA:, General with endotracheal intubation. ,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. His abdomen was prepped and draped in a standard, sterile surgical fashion. A Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression. Marcaine was injected into his umbilicus. A small incision was made. A Veress needle was introduced in his abdomen. CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg and a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through his umbilicus. A 5-mm port was then placed just to the right side of the umbilicus. Another 5-mm port was placed just suprapubic in the midline. Upon inspection of the cecum, I was able find an inflamed and indurated appendix. I was able to clear the mesentery at the base of the appendix between the appendix and the cecum. I fired a white load stapler across the appendix at its base and fired a grey load stapler across the mesentery, and thereby divided the mesentery and freed the appendix. I put the appendix in an Endocatch bag and removed it through the umbilicus. I irrigated out the abdomen. I then closed the fascia of the umbilicus with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason and closed the skin of all incisions with a running Monocryl. Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.gastroenterology, foley catheter, co2 insufflation, endotracheal intubation, laparoscopic appendectomy, appendectomy, intubation, cecum, laparoscopic, appendicitis, endotracheal, abdomen, mesentery, umbilicus, appendix,
