Blood In Toilet, CHIEF COMPLAINT: ,Blood in toilet.,HISTORY:, Ms. ABC is a 77-year-old female who is brought down by way of ambulance from XYZ Nursing Home after nursing staff had noted there to be blood in the toilet after she had been sitting on the toilet. They did not note any urine or stool in the toilet and the patient had no acute complaints. The patient is unfortunately a poor historian in that she has dementia and does not recall any of the events. The patient herself has absolutely no complaints, such as abdominal pain or back pain, urinary and GI complaints. There is no other history provided by the nursing staff from XYZ. There apparently were no clots noted within there. She does not have a history of being on anticoagulants.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Actually quite limited, includes that of dementia, asthma, anemia which is chronic, hypothyroidism, schizophrenia, positive PPD in the past.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: ,Unknown.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, No tobacco or alcohol.,MEDICATIONS:, Listed in the medical records.,ALLERGIES:, No known drug allergies.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, VITAL SIGNS: Stable.,GENERAL: This is a well-nourished, well-developed female who is alert, oriented in all spheres, pleasant, cooperative, resting comfortably, appearing otherwise healthy and well in no acute distress.,HEENT: Visually normal.

We have decided to send the patient back to XYZ with observation by the staff there. She will have a CBC done daily for the next 3 days with results to Dr. X.
