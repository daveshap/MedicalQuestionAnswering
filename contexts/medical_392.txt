Radiofrequency Thermocoagulation - 1, PROCEDURE:, Radiofrequency thermocoagulation of bilateral lumbar sympathetic chain.,ANESTHESIA:, Local sedation.,VITAL SIGNS:, See nurse's notes.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: ,INT was placed. The patient was in the operating room in the prone position with the back prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The patient was given sedation and monitored. Lidocaine 1.5% for skin wheal was made 10 cm from the midline to the bilateral L2 distal vertebral body. A 20-gauge, 15 cm SMK needle was then directed using AP and fluoroscopic guidance so that the tip of the needle was noted to be along the distal one-third and anterior border on the lateral view and on the AP view the tip of the needle was inside the lateral third of the border of the vertebral body. At this time a negative motor stimulation was obtained. Injection of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plus 10 mg of Depo-Medrol was performed. Coagulation was then carried out for 90oC for 90 seconds. At the conclusion of this, the needle under fluoroscopic guidance was withdrawn approximately 5 mm where again a negative motor stimulation was obtained and the sequence of injection and coagulation was repeated. This was repeated one more time with a 5 mm withdrawal and coagulation.,At that time, attention was directed to the L3 body where the needle was placed to the upper one-third/distal two-thirds junction and the sequence of injection, coagulation, and negative motor stimulation with needle withdrawal one time of a 5 mm distance was repeated. There were no compilations from this. The patient was discharged to operating room recovery in stable condition.surgery, lumbar sympathetic chain, vertebral body, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, motor stimulation, thermocoagulation, radiofrequency, coagulation, needle,
