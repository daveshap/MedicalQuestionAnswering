Letter - Dentistry, XYZ, S.,RE: ABC,Dear Dr. XYZ,On your kind referral, I had the pleasure of meeting and consulting with ABC on MM/DD/YYYY for evaluation regarding extraction of his mandibular left second molar tooth #18. This previously root-canaled tooth, now failed, is scheduled for removal. As per your request, I agree that placement of an implant in the #20 and #19 positions would allow for immediate functional replacement of the bridge which has recently been lost in this area.,I have given Mr. ABC an estimate for the surgical aspects of this case and suggested he combine this with your prosthetic or restorative fees in order to have a full understanding of the costs involved with this process.,We will plan to place two Straumann implants as per our normal protocol, one each in the #19 and 20 positions, with the #19 implant being a wide-neck, larger diameter implant. I will plan on providing the prosthetic abutments, the lab analogue, and temporary healing cap at the end of the four-month integration period. If you have any additional suggestions or concerns, please give me a call.,Best regards,,dentistry, molar tooth, extraction, mandibular, straumann, wide-neck, placement, positions, prosthetic, implant, tooth
