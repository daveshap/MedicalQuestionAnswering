Lightheadedness, HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient comes in today because of feeling lightheaded and difficulty keeping his balance. He denies this as a spinning sensation that he had had in the past with vertigo. He just describes as feeling very lightheaded. It usually occurs with position changes such as when he stands up from the sitting position or stands up from a lying position. It tends to ease when he sits down again, but does not totally resolve for another 15 to 30 minutes and he feels shaky and weak all over. Lorazepam did not help this sensation.
