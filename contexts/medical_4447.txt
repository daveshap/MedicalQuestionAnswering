HCT,1/15/93: low density focus in the right medial and posterior cerebellar hemisphere. MRI and MRA, 1/18/93, revealed a well circumscribed lesion within the posterior aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere suggestive of vascular malformation (e.g. cavernous angioma. An abnormal vascular blush was seen on the MRA. This area appeared to be supplied by one of the external carotid arteries (which one is was not specified). this finding maybe suggestive of a vascular malformation. 1/20/93 Cerebral Angiogram: The right cerebellar hemisphere lesion seen on MRI as a possible cavernous angioma was not seen on angiography. Upon review of the MRI and HCT the lesion was felt to probably represent an old infarction with hemosiderin deposition. The vascular blush seen on MRA was no visualized on angiography. The patient was discharged home on 1/25/93.consult - history and phy., avm, episode of lightheadedness, vascular malformation, cavernous angioma, vascular blush, cerebellar hemisphere, malformation, cavernous, angioma, angiography, lightheadedness, hemisphere, vertigo, cerebellar,
