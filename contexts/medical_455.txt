Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter Insertion, PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Renal failure.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Renal failure.,OPERATION PERFORMED:, Insertion of peritoneal dialysis catheter.,ANESTHESIA:, General.,INDICATIONS: ,This 14-year-old young lady is in the renal failure and in need of dialysis. She had had a previous PD catheter placed, but it became infected and had to be removed. She, therefore, comes back to the operating room for a new PD catheter.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: ,After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual manner. A small transverse right upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection. The fascia was divided and the posterior fascia and peritoneum were identified. A hole was made in the posterior fascia through the peritoneum and into the peritoneal cavity. The omentum came up through the hole and so therefore the omentum was actually brought up and a small portion of it removed, which could easily be brought up through the incision. A PD catheter was then placed into the pelvis over a guidewire. At this point, the peritoneum and posterior fascia was closed around the catheter. The anterior fascia was then closed over the top of the cuff leaving the cuff buried in the fascia. The second incision was then made lateral and the catheter brought out through a second incision and the subcutaneous cuff then positioned at that site. The catheter was then connected and two runs of a 150 mL of fluid were made with a good inflow and a good clear return. The skin was closed with 5-0 subcuticular Monocryl. Sterile dressings were applied and the young lady awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.surgery, pd catheter, catheter, omentum, peritoneal dialysis catheter, peritoneal dialysis, renal failure, peritoneal, dialysis, renal
