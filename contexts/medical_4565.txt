She denies any history of cancer. She does have a history of hepatitis which I will need to further investigate.

She had one ovary removed at the time of the hysterectomy as well.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, She is a single mother of one adopted child.,FAMILY HISTORY: ,There is a strong family history of heart disease and hypertension, as well as diabetes on both sides of her family. Her mother is alive. Her father is deceased from alcohol.

We will see her back in the office once she completes her preliminary workup and submit her for approval to the insurance company.consult - history and phy., evaluation for bariatric surgery, bariatric surgery, varicose veins, weight loss, varicose, veins, diabetes, bariatric, surgical, loss, surgery, hypertension, weight,
