3, Heart Catheterization, Ventriculography, & Angiography - 3, NAME OF PROCEDURE:, Left heart catheterization with ventriculography, selective coronary angiography.,INDICATIONS:, Acute coronary syndrome.,TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE:, Standard Judkins, right groin. Catheters used were a 6 French pigtail, 6 French JL4, 6 French JR4. ,ANTICOAGULATION: ,The patient was on heparin at the time.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,I reviewed with the patient the pros, cons, alternatives, risks of catheterization and sedation including myocardial infarction, stroke, death, damage to nerve, artery or vein in the leg, perforation of a cardiac chamber, dissection of an artery requiring countershock, infection, bleeding, ATN allergy, need for cardiac surgery. All questions were answered, and the patient desired to proceed.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA: ,Aortic pressure was in the physiologic range. No significant gradient across the aortic valve.,ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA,1. Ventriculogram: The left ventricle is of normal size and shape, normal wall motion, normal ejection fraction.,2. Right coronary artery: Dominant. There was insignificant disease in the system.,3. Left coronary: Left main, left anterior descending and circumflex systems showed no significant disease.,CONCLUSIONS,1. Normal left ventricular systolic function.,2. Insignificant coronary disease.,PLAN:, Based upon this study, medical therapy is warranted. Six-French Angio-Seal was used in the groin.cardiovascular / pulmonary, standard judkins, french pigtail, selective coronary angiography, heart catheterization, ventriculography, catheterization, angiography,
