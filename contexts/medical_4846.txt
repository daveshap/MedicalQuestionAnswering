Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) - 3, EXAM:, Coronary artery CTA with calcium scoring and cardiac function.,HISTORY:, Chest pain.,TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:, Coronary artery CTA was performed on a Siemens dual-source CT scanner. Post-processing on a Vitrea workstation. 150 mL Ultravist 370 was utilized as the intravenous contrast agent. Patient did receive nitroglycerin sublingually prior to the contrast.,HISTORY:, Significant for high cholesterol, overweight, chest pain, family history,Patient's total calcium score (Agatston) is 10. his places the patient just below the 75th percentile for age.,The LAD has a moderate area of stenosis in its midportion due to a focal calcified plaque. The distal LAD was unreadable while the proximal was normal. The mid and distal right coronary artery are not well delineated due to beam-hardening artifact.

No gross pulmonary artery abnormality however they are not well delineated. A full report was placed on the patient's chart. Report was saved to PACS.cardiovascular / pulmonary, coronary artery cta, calcium scoring, cardiac function, coronary artery, ct, scoring, lad, midportion, cta, calcium, cardiac, coronary, artery, angiography,
