Bronchoscopy & Foreign Body Removal, PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Foreign body in airway.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Plastic piece foreign body in the right main stem bronchus.,PROCEDURE:, Rigid bronchoscopy with foreign body removal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:, This patient is 7-month-old baby boy who presented to emergency room today with increasing stridor and shortness of breath according to mom. The patient had a chest x-ray and based on that there is concern by the Radiology it could be a foreign body in the right main stem. The patient has been taken to the operating room for rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general mask anesthesia. Using a 3.5 rigid bronchoscope we visualized between the cords into the trachea. There were some secretions but that looked okay. Got down at the level of the carina to see a foreign body flapping in the right main stem. I then used graspers to grasp to try to pull into the scope itself. I could not do that, I thus had to pull the scope out along with the foreign body that was held on to with a grasper. It appeared to be consisting of some type of plastic piece that had broke off some different object. I took the scope and put it back down into the airway again. Again, there was secretion in the trachea that we suctioned out. We looked down into the right bronchus intermedius. There was no other pathology noted, just some irritation in the right main stem area. I looked down the left main stem as well and that looked okay as well. I then withdrew the scope. Trachea looked fine as well as the cords. I put the patient back on mask oxygen to wake the patient up. The patient tolerated the procedure well.cardiovascular / pulmonary, main stem bronchus, bronchoscopy, airway, foreign body removal, rigid bronchoscopy,
