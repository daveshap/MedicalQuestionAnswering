I found some small internal hemorrhoids and no fistulous tracts.,Then, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion and the abscess area, which was in the left gluteal side, was incised with a cruciate incision and drained. All necrotic tissue was debrided. The cavity was digitally explored and found to have no communication to any deeper structures or to the colorectal area. The cavity was irrigated with saline and then was packed with iodoform gauze and dressed.,Estimated blood loss was minimal.
