Before the neck instrumentation was performed, the patient's lacerations to her scalp were I&D'ed and closed. It was noted that the head was significantly contaminated with blood as well as mangled. It was decided at that time in order to repair the lacerations appropriately, the patient would undergo cutting of her hair. This was shaved appropriately with shavers. Once this was done, the scalp lacerations were copiously irrigated with a scrubbing brush, hexedine solution together with peroxide. Once this was appropriately debrided with regards to the midline incision with the scalp going through the midline of her skull as well as the incision on the left aspect of her scalp, the wounds were significantly irrigated with normal saline. No significant debris was appreciated. Once this was done, staples were used to oppose the dermal edges together. The patient was subsequently dressed sterilely using bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4x4s, and tape.
