The incision was performed with a #15 blade. An 18-gauge needle and 10 mL syringe was used to evacuate a small amount of the purulence from the abscess cavity. This was submitted for culture and sensitivity, anaerobic cultures and Gram stain. The cavity was opened with a small hemostat and a great deal of grossly purulent material was evacuated. The cavity was irrigated with peroxide and saline. A 0.25-inch Penrose drain was placed and secured with a single #3-0 nylon suture. A 4 x 4 dressing was applied. Bleeding was negligible. There were no untoward complications.
