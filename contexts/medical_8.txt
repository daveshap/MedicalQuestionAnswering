Doppler interrogation, including color flow imaging, reveals systemic venous return to the right atrium with normal tricuspid inflow. Pulmonary outflow is normal at the valve. Pulmonary venous return is to the left atrium. The interatrial septum is intact. Mitral inflow and ascending aorta flow are normal. The aortic valve is trileaflet. The coronary arteries appear to be normal in their origins. The aortic arch is left-sided and patent with normal descending aorta pulsatility.cardiovascular / pulmonary, 2-d echocardiogram, cardiac function, doppler, echocardiogram, multiple views, aortic valve, coronary arteries, descending aorta, great vessels, heart, hypertrophy, interatrial septum, intracardiac, pericardial effusion, tricuspid, vegetation, venous, pulmonaryNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.
