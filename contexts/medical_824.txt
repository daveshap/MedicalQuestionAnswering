Excision - Hydradenitis, PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Bilateral hydradenitis, chronic.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Bilateral hydradenitis, chronic.,NAME OF OPERATION:, Excision of bilateral chronic hydradenitis.,ANESTHESIA:, Local.,FINDINGS:, This patient had previously had excision of hydradenitis. However, she had residual disease in both axilla with chronic redraining of the cyst from hydradenitis. This now is controlled and it was found to be suitable for excision. There was an area in each axilla which needed to be excised.,PROCEDURE:, Under local infiltration and after routine prepping and draping, an elliptical incision was first made on the left side to encompass the area of chronic hydradenitis. This wound was then irrigated with saline. The deeper layers were closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed using interrupted 5-0 nylon.,Attention was then directed to the right side where a similar procedure was carried out encompassing the involved area with the closure being identical to the opposite side. This appeared to encompass all of the active area of hydradenitis.,The needle counts were all correct. No intraoperative complications were encountered. Dressings were applied, and the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.surgery, hydradenitis, elliptical incision, bilateral hydradenitis, chronic hydradenitis, axilla, excision, chronic,
