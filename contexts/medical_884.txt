An area of the scalp was shaved above the ear and then also 1% Xylocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine injected, a total of 4 mL local anesthetic was used. The ear was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The microscope was then brought into view and examining the marginal perforation, the patient was noted to have large granuloma under the tympanic membrane at the anterior border of the drum. The granulation tissue was debrided as much as possible. Decision was made to cancel the tympanoplasty after debriding the middle ear space as much as possible. The middle ear space was filled with Floxin drops. The patient woke up anesthesia, extubated, and brought to recovery room in stable condition. There were no intraoperative complications.
