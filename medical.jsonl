General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made. The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp. A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident. Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening. Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar. A total of 3 other trocars were placed. The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position. The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior iliac spine. The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars. All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.,The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left. The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder. A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free.,A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct proximally and distally. The duct was divided between the clips. The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct. The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posterior to the cystic duct. It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues. A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally. The artery was divided between the clips. The 2 midline port sites were injected with 5% Marcaine.,After the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula. The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula. As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen. The neck of the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen. Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen.,Both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture. All skin incisions were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. Dressings were applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.gastroenterology, langer's lines, laparoscope, cystic duct, cystic artery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, midline cannula, infraumbilical, tonsil, cholecystectomy, fascia, abdomen, trocars, cannula, laparoscopic, gallbladder, \n\nLIST ALL DIAGNOSIS: ", "completion": " Laparoscopic cholecystectomy"}

At the time of my exam, he states that his left lower extremity pain has improved considerably. He apparently had more significant paresthesias in the past and now he feels that the paresthesias have improved considerably.

He currently has a viable extremity and viable foot, but certainly has significant making compromised flow. It is unclear to me whether this is chronic or acute, and whether he is a candidate for any type of intervention. He certainly would benefit from an angiogram to better to define his anatomy and anticoagulation in the meantime. Given his potential history of recent lower GI bleeding, he has been evaluated by GI to see whether or not he is a candidate for heparinization. We will order an angiogram for the next few hours and followup on those results to better define his anatomy and to determine whether or not if any interventions are appropriate. Again, at this point, he has no pain, relatively rapid capillary refill, and relatively normal motor function suggesting a viable extremity.

Operating microscope was used for both illumination and magnification.,FIRST ASSISTANT:, Nurse practitioner.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, The patient was placed in supine position. The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior discectomy and fusion. An incision was made midline to the anterior body of the sternocleidomastoid at C5-C6 level. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma muscle was divided exposing the carotid sheath, which was retracted laterally. Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially. After placing the self-retaining retractors with the longus colli muscles having been dissected away from the vertebral bodies at C5 and C6 and confirming our position with intraoperative x-rays, we then proceeded with the discectomy.,We then cleaned out the disc at C5-C6 after incising the annulus fibrosis. We cleaned out the disc with a combination of angled and straight pituitary rongeurs and curettes, and the next step was to clean out the disc space totally. With this having been done, we then turned our attention with the operating microscope to the osteophytes. We drilled off the vertebral osteophytes at C5-C6, as well as the uncovertebral osteophytes. This was removed along with the posterior longitudinal ligament. After we had done this, the dural sac was opposed very nicely and both C6 nerve roots were thoroughly decompressed. The next step after the decompression of the thecal sac and both C6 nerve roots was the fusion. We observed that there was a ____________ in the posterior longitudinal ligament. There was a free fragment disc, which had broken through the posterior longitudinal ligament just to the right of midline.,The next step was to obtain the bone from the back bone, using cortical cancellous graft 10 mm in size after we had estimated the size.

Dissecting further, the peritoneal cavity was entered. Once this done, a Hasson trocar was secured with #1 Vicryl and the abdomen was insufflated without difficulty. A camera was placed into the abdomen and there was noted to be omentum overlying the subhepatic space. A second trocar was placed in the standard fashion in the subxiphoid area; this was a 10/12 mm non-bladed trocar. Once this was done, a grasper was used to try and mobilize the omentum and a second grasper was added in the right costal margin; this was a 5-mm port placed, it was non-bladed and placed in the usual fashion under direct visualization without difficulty. A grasper was used to mobilize free the omentum which was acutely friable and after a significant time-consuming effort was made to mobilize the omentum, it was clear that the gallbladder was well incorporated by the omentum and it would be unsafe to proceed with a laparoscopy procedure and then the procedure was converted to open.,The trocars were removed and a right subcostal incision was made incorporating the 10/12 subxiphoid port. The subcutaneous space was divided with electrocautery, as well as the muscles and fascia. The Bookwalter retraction system was then set up and retractors were placed to provide exposure to the right subhepatic space. Then utilizing a right-angle and electrocautery, the omentum was freed from the gallbladder. An ensuing retrograde cholecystectomy was performed, in which, electrocautery and blunt dissection were used to mobilize the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa; this was done down to the infundibulum. After meticulous dissection, the cystic artery was identified and it was ligated between 3-0 silks. Several other small ties were placed on smaller bleeding vessels and the cystic duct was identified, was skeletonized, and a 3-0 stick tie was placed on the proximal portion of it.

Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The patient's right ear was carefully prepped and then draped in the usual sterile fashion. Slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine. The earlobe was also infiltrated with the same solution. A limited incision was made in the earlobe harvesting a small bit of fat from the earlobe that was diced and the donor site closed with interrupted sutures of 5-0 nylon. This could later be removed in bishop. A reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished. A 65 Beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock. Jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation. Elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus. An annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament. The tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain. Palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified. Palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement. A house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani. The nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well. The self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse. The stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured. The fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation. A small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston. The measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire Teflon piston chosen. It was placed in the middle ear atraumatically with a small alligator forceps and was directed towards the fenestration in the footplate. The hook was placed over the incus and measurement appeared to be appropriate. A downbiting crimper was then used to complete the attachment of the prosthesis to the incus. Prosthesis is once again checked for location and centering and appeared to be in ideal position. Small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph. A small pledget of fat was also placed on the top of the incudo-prosthesis junction. The mobility appeared excellent. The flap was placed back in its normal anatomic position. The external canal packed with small pledgets of Gelfoam and antibiotic ointment. She was then awakened and taken to the recovery room in a stable condition with discharge anticipated later this day to Bishop.

He has had a STING procedure performed but continues to have reflux bilaterally. Plan is for another injection.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, IV antibiotics were given. He was then placed in a lithotomy position with adequate padding of his arms and legs. His urethra was calibrated to 12-French with a bougie a boule. A 9.5-French cystoscope was used and the offset system was then used. His urethra was normal without valves or strictures. His bladder was fairly normal with minimal trabeculations but no cystitis noted. Upon evaluation, the patient's right ureteral orifice was found to be remarkably gaping and the Deflux that was present was not in or near ureteral orifice but it was inferior to it below the trigone. This was similarly found on the left side where the Deflux was not close to the orifice as well. It was slightly more difficult because of the amount impacted upon our angle for injection. We were able to ultimately get the Deflux to go ahead with HIT technique on the right into the ureter itself to inject a total of 1.5 mL to include the HIT technique as well as the ureteral orifice itself on the right and left sides and some on the uppermost aspect. Once we injected this, we ran the irrigant over the orifice and it no longer fluttered and there was no bleeding. Similar procedure was done on the left. This was actually more difficult as the Deflux injection from before displaced the ureter slightly more laterally but again HIT technique was performed. There was some mild bleeding and Deflux was used to stop this as well and again no evidence of fluttering of the ureteral orifice after injection. At the end of the procedure, the irrigant was drained and 2% lidocaine jelly was instilled in the urethra.

The patient has had previous tube placement. Tubes have since plugged and are no more functioning. The patient has had recent recurrent otitis media. Risks and benefits in terms of bleeding, anesthesia, and tympanic membrane perforation were discussed with the mother. Mother wished to proceed with the surgery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, The patient was brought to the room, placed supine. The patient was given general endotracheal anesthesia. Starting on the left ear, under microscopic visualization, the ear was cleaned of wax. A Bobbin tube was found stuck to the tympanic membrane. This was removed. After removing the tube the patient was found to have microperforation through which serous fluid was draining. A fresh myringotomy was made in the anterior inferior quadrant. More serous fluid was aspirated from middle ear space. The new Bobbin tube was easily placed. Floxin drops were placed in the ear. In the right ear again under microscopic visualization, the ear was cleaned, the tube was removed off tympanic membrane. There was no perforation seen; however, there was some granulation tissue on the surface of tympanic membrane. A fresh myringotomy incision was made in the anterior inferior quadrant. More serous fluid was drained out of middle ear space. The tube was easily placed and Floxin drops were placed in the ear. This completes tube portion of the surgery. The patient was then turned and placed in the Rose position. Shoulder roll was placed for neck extension. Using a small McIvor mouth gag mouth was held open. Using a rubber catheter the soft palate was retracted. Under mirror visualization, the nasopharynx was examined. The patient was found to have minimal adenoidal tissue.

The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain. Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle. Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed. Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis. The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed. The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A midline scrotal incision was made. There was very, very thick scrotal skin. There was no necrotic skin. As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum. The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus. The pus just poured out of the left testicle. The left testicle was completely removed. Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue. Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum. There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement. A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum. I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal. So, the right hemiscrotum was opened. The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick. The testicle appeared normal. There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum. At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion. The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress. There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy.

The most recent one which I performed quite a number of years ago that was complicated by a bone flap infection and he has had removal of his bone flap. He has been without the bone flap for a number of years now but has finally decided that he wanted to proceed with a cranioplasty. After discussing the risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery, the decision was made to proceed with operative intervention in the form of a cranioplasty. He had previously undergone a CT scan. Premanufactured cranioplasty made for him that was sterile and ready to implant.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, an appropriate time out was performed. We identified the patient, the location of surgery, the appropriate surgical procedure, and the appropriate implant. He was given intravenous antibiotics with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and Flagyl appropriately for antibiotic prophylaxis and sequential compression devices were used for deep venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A previous incision was reopened and the scalp flap was reflected forward. We dissected off the dura and we were able to get a nice plane of dissection elevating the temporalis muscle along with the scalp flap. We freed up the bony edges circumferentially, but except for the inferior frontal region where the vascularized pericranial graft took its vascular supply from we did not come across the base. We did explore laterally and saw a little bit of the mesh on the lateral orbit. Once we had the bony edges explored, we took the performed plate and secured it in a place with titanium plates and screws. We had achieved good hemostasis. The wound was closed in multiple layers in usual fashion over a Blake drain. At the end of the procedure, all sponge and needle counts were correct. A sterile dressing was applied to the incision.

He was placed under general endotracheal tube anesthesia by the Department of Anesthesia. The bed was then rolled away from Department of Anesthesia. A shoulder roll was then placed beneath the shoulder blades and a blue towel was then fashioned as a turban wrap. The McIvor mouth gag was carefully positioned into the patient's mouth with attention to avoid the teeth.,The retractor was then opened and the oropharynx was visualized. The adenoid pad was then visualized with a laryngeal mirror. The adenoids appeared to be 1+ and non-obstructing. There was no evidence of submucosal cleft palate palpable.

Bovie cautery was used to make an incision on the mucosa of the right anterior tonsillar pillar to find the appropriate plane of dissection. The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using a Bovie. Tonsillar sponge was re-applied to the tonsillar fossa. Suction cautery was then used to adequately obtain hemostasis with the tonsillar fossa. Attention was then directed to the left tonsil. The curved Allis was used to grasp the superior pole of the left tonsil and it was retracted inferiorly and medially. Bovie cautery was used to make an incision in the mucosa of the left anterior tonsillar pillar and define the appropriate plane of dissection. The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using the Bovie. Next, complete hemostasis was achieved within the tonsillar fossae using suction cautery. After adequate hemostasis was obtained, attention was directed towards the adenoid pad. The adenoid pad was again visualized and appeared 1+ and was non-obstructing. Decision was made to use suction cautery to cauterize the adenoids. Using a laryngeal mirror under direct visualization, the adenoid pad was then cauterized with care to avoid the eustachian tube orifices as well as the soft palate and inferior turbinates. After cauterization was complete, the nasopharynx was again visualized and tonsillar sponge was applied. Adequate hemostasis was achieved. The tonsillar fossae were again visualized and no evidence of bleeding was evident. The throat pack was removed from the oropharynx and the oropharynx was suctioned. There was no evidence of any further bleeding. A flexible suction catheter was then used to suction out the nasopharynx to the oropharynx. The suction catheter was also used to suction up the stomach.

A 6-French arterial sheath was placed in the usual fashion. Left and right coronary angiograms were then performed in various projections after heparin was given 2000 units intraaortic. The right coronary artery was difficult to cannulate because of its high anterior takeoff. This was nondominant. Several catheters were used. Ultimately, an AL1 diagnostic catheter was used. A pigtail catheter was advanced across the aortic valve. Left ventriculogram was then done in the RAO view using 30 mL of contrast. Pullback gradient was obtained across the aortic valve. Femoral angiogram was performed through the sheath which was above the bifurcation, was removed with a Perclose device with good results. There were no complications. He tolerated this procedure well and returned to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1. Right coronary artery: This has an unusual high anterior takeoff. The vessel is nondominant, has diffuse mild-to-moderate disease.,2. Left main trunk: A 30% to 40% distal narrowing is present.,3. Left anterior descending: Just at the ostium of the vessel and up to and including the bifurcation of the first large diagonal branch, there is 80 to 90% narrowing. The diagonal is a large vessel about 3 mm in size.,4. Circumflex: Dominant vessel, 50% narrowing at the origin of the obtuse marginal. After this, there is 40% narrowing in the AV trunk. The small posterior lateral branch has diffuse mild disease and then the vessel gives rise to a fairly large posterior ventricular branch, which has 70% ostial narrowing, and then after this the posterior descending has 80% narrowing at its origin.,5. Left ventriculogram: Normal volume in diastole and systole. Normal systolic function is present. There is no mitral insufficiency or left ventricular outflow obstruction.,DIAGNOSES,1. Severe complex left anterior descending and distal circumflex disease with borderline, probably moderate narrowing of a large obtuse marginal branch. Dominant circumflex system. Severe disease of the posterior descending. Mild left main trunk disease.,2. Normal left ventricular systolic function.,Given the complex anatomy of the predominant problem which is the left anterior descending; given its ostial stenosis and involvement of the bifurcation of the diagonal, would recommend coronary bypass surgery. The patient also has severe disease of the circumflex which is dominant. This anatomy is not appropriate for percutaneous intervention.

He is almost 3 years old. He presented with 2 months of irritability, vomiting, and increasing seizures. CT scan was not conclusive, but shuntogram shows no flow through the shunt.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with his head turned to the left. Scalp was clipped. He was prepped on the head, neck, chest and abdomen with ChloraPrep. Incisions were infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000. He received oxacillin.,He was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,The frontal incision was reopened and extended along the valve. Subcutaneous sharp dissection with Bovie cautery was done to expose the shunt parts. I separated the ventricular catheter from the valve, and this was a medium pressure small contour Medtronic valve. There was some flow from the ventricular catheter, but not as much as I would expect. I removed the right-angled clip with a curette and then pulled out the ventricular catheter, and there was gushing of CSF under high pressure. So, I do believe that the catheter was obstructed, although inspection of the old catheter holes did not show any specific obstructions. A new Codman BACTISEAL catheter was placed through the same hole. I replaced it several times because I wanted to be sure it was in the cavity. It entered easily and there was still just intermittent flow of CSF. The catheter irrigated very well and seemed to be patent.,I tested the distal system with an irrigation filled feeding tube, and there was excellent flow through the distal valve and catheter. So I did not think it was necessary to replace those at this time. The new catheter was trimmed to a total length of 8 cm and attached to the proximal end of the valve. The valve connection was secured to the pericranium with a #2-0 Ethibond suture. The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation. The shunt pumped and refilled well. The wound was then closed with #4-0 Vicryl interrupted galeal suture and Steri-Strips on the skin. It was uncertain whether this will correct the problem or not, but we will continue to evaluate. If his abdominal pressure is too high, then he may need a different valve. This will be determined over time, but at this time, the shunt seemed to empty and refill easily.

She was admitted through the emergency room with abdominal pain, elevated bilirubin, and gallstones on ultrasound with a dilated common bile duct. She subsequently went for a HIDA scan to rule out cholecystitis. Gallbladder was filled but was unable to empty into the small bowel consistent with the common bile duct blockage. She was taken to the operating room that night for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We proceeded with laparoscopic cholecystectomy and during the cholangiogram there was no contrast. It was able to be extravasated into the duodenum with the filling defect consistent with the distal common bile duct stone. The patient had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass but could not receive an ERCP and stone extraction, therefore, common bile duct exploration was performed and a stone was extracted. This necessitated conversion to an open operation. She was transferred to the medical surgical unit postoperatively. She had a significant amount of incisional pain following morning, but no nausea. A Jackson-Pratt drain, which was left in place in two places showed serosanguineous fluid. White blood cell count was down to 7500 and bilirubin decreased to 2.1.

Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The patient's right ear was carefully prepped and then draped in the usual sterile fashion. Slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine. The earlobe was also infiltrated with the same solution. A limited incision was made in the earlobe harvesting a small bit of fat from the earlobe that was diced and the donor site closed with interrupted sutures of 5-0 nylon. This could later be removed in bishop. A reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished. A 65 Beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock. Jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation. Elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus. An annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament. The tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain. Palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified. Palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement. A house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani. The nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well. The self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse. The stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured. The fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation. A small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston. The measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire Teflon piston chosen. It was placed in the middle ear atraumatically with a small alligator forceps and was directed towards the fenestration in the footplate. The hook was placed over the incus and measurement appeared to be appropriate. A downbiting crimper was then used to complete the attachment of the prosthesis to the incus. Prosthesis is once again checked for location and centering and appeared to be in ideal position. Small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph. A small pledget of fat was also placed on the top of the incudo-prosthesis junction. The mobility appeared excellent. The flap was placed back in its normal anatomic position. The external canal packed with small pledgets of Gelfoam and antibiotic ointment. She was then awakened and taken to the recovery room in a stable condition with discharge anticipated later this day to Bishop. Sutures will be out in a week and a recheck in Reno in four to five weeks from now.ent - otolaryngology, bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss, argon laser assisted, conductive hearing losses, intubation, argon, stapedectomy, otosclerosis, canal, earlobe, prosthesis, pledgets, laser \n\nLIST ALL MEDICATION: ", "completion": " antibiotic ointment"}

The sac was turned upside down and sutures were placed. Careful attention was made to ensure that the cord was open. The testicle was in normal orientation throughout the entire procedure. The testicle was placed back into the scrotal sac and was pexed with 4-0 Vicryl to the outside dartos to ensure that there was no risk of torsion. Orchiopexy was done at 3 different locations. Hemostasis was obtained using electrocautery. The sac was closed using 4-0 Vicryl. The sac was turned upside down so that when it heals, the fluid would not recollect. The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl and Dermabond was applied. Incision measured about 2 cm in size. Subsequently using ACMI cystoscope, a cystoscopy was performed. The urethra appeared normal. There was some scarring at the bulbar urethra, but the scope went in through that area very easily into the bladder. There was a short prostatic fossa. The bladder appeared normal. There was some moderate trabeculation throughout the bladder, some inflammatory changes in the bag part, but nothing of much significance. There were no papillary tumors or stones inside the bladder. Bilateral pyelograms were obtained using 8-French cone-tip catheter, which appeared normal. A cold cup biopsy of the bladder was done and was fulgurated for hemostasis.

General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. The Right groin and abdomen were prepped and draped in the standard sterile surgical fashion. An incision was made approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the pubic tubercle and in a skin crease. Dissection was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Scarpa's fascia was divided, and the external ring was located. The external oblique was divided from the external ring up towards the anterior superior iliac spine.

I opened the floor of the inguinal canal and dissected out the preperitoneal space at the direct sac and cut out the direct sac. Once I cleared out the preperitoneal space, I placed a PHS mesh system with a posterior mesh into the preperitoneal space, and I made sure that it laid flat along Cooper's ligament and covered the myopectineal orifice.

Lymph node biopsy, level 7 subcarinal showing (5) lymph nodes with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor.,COMMENT: ,The morphology of the tumor seen in both lobes is similar and we feel that the smaller tumor involving the right lower lobe is most likely secondary to transbronchial spread from the main tumor involving the right upper lobe. This suggestion is supported by the fact that no obvious vascular or lymphatic invasion is demonstrated and adjacent to the smaller tumor, there is isolated nests of tumor cells within the air spaces. Furthermore, immunoperoxidase stain for Ck-7, CK-20 and TTF are performed on both the right lower and right upper lobe nodule. The immunohistochemical results confirm the lung origin of both tumors and we feel that the tumor involving the right lower lobe is due to transbronchial spread from the larger tumor nodule involving the right upper lobe.,lab medicine - pathology, pet scan, wedge biopsy, morphology, lung wedge biopsy, lymph node biopsy, lymph node, lower lobe, tumor, biopsy, lobe, lung, mass, lymph, node \n\nLIST ALL MEDICATION: ", "completion": " None Found"}

After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the right arm was circumferentially prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion. A longitudinal incision was made from just above the antecubital crease along the medial aspect of the arm overlying the palpable thrill using a 15 blade knife. The sharp dissection was then used to identify dissection created of the basilic vein from its surrounding tissues. This was continued and the incision was elongated up the arm as the vein was exposed in a serial fashion. Branch points were then taken down using multitude of techniques based upon the luminal diameter of the branch before transection. The basilic vein was ultimately freed in its entirety from just above the antecubital crease to the axilla at the level of the axillary vein. There was noted to be excellent flow through the vein. A pocket was then created just lateral to the incision in the subcutaneous tissue. The vein was then placed into this pocket securing with multiple interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The bed of dissection of the basilic vein was then treated with fibrin sealant. The subcutaneous tissue was then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl sutures in interrupted fashion. The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl suture for a subcuticular stitch. Dermabond was applied to the incision. Again, there was noted to be good palpable thrill throughout the superficialized vein.

There was no evidence of chondromalacia, cracking, or fissuring of the articular cartilage. The patella was well centered over the trochlear notch. We then directed the arthroscope to the medial compartment of the knee. It was felt that there was a tear to the medial meniscus. We also saw large area of chondromalacia with grade-IV changes to bone over the medial femoral condyle. This area was debrided with forceps and the arthroscopic shaver. The cartilage was also smoothened over the medial femoral condyle. This was curetted after the medial meniscus had been trimmed. We looked into the notch. We saw the ACL appeared stable, saw attachments to tibial as well as the femoral insertion with some evidence of laxity, wear and tear. Attention then was taken to the lateral compartment with some evidence of tear to the lateral meniscus and the arterial surface of both the tibia as well as the femur were pristine in the lateral compartment.

He was evaluated by the Emergency Room staff as well as the medical team and the Department of Orthopedics. It was noted upon x-ray a foreign body in his foot and he had significant amount of cellulitis as well ________ right lower extremity. After a long discussion held with the patient, it was elected to proceed with irrigation debridement and removal of the foreign body.,PROCEDURE:, After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, operative surgeon, the Department of Anesthesia and nursing staff. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #5 and placed on the operating table in supine position. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. The Department of Anesthesia was administered spinal anesthetic to the patient. Once this anesthesia was obtained, the patient's right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Upon viewing of the plantar aspect of the foot, there was noted to be a swollen ecchymotic area with a small hole in it, which purulent fluid was coming from. At this time, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified as well as the localization of the pus, a 2 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this area, which was located between the second and third metatarsal heads. Upon incising this, there was a foul smelling purulent fluid, which flowed from this region. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken as well as gram stain. The area was explored and it ________ to the dorsum of the foot. There was no obvious joint involvement. After all loculations were broken, 3 liters antibiotic-impregnated fluid were pulse-evac through the wound. The wound was again inspected with no more gross purulent or necrotic appearing tissue. The wound was then packed with an iodoform gauge and a sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, floss, and Kerlix covered by an Ace bandage. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit.

The palmar fascia was divided exposing the transverse carpal ligament, which was incised longitudinally. A Freer was then inserted beneath the ligament, and dissection was carried out proximally and distally.,After adequate release has been formed, the wound was irrigated and closed with nylon. The medial approach to the elbow was then performed and the skin was opened and subcutaneous tissues were dissected. A medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve was identified and protected throughout the case. The ulnar nerve was noted to be subluxing over the superior aspect of the medial epicondyle and flattened and inflamed. The ulnar nerve was freed proximally and distally. The medial intramuscular septum was excised and the flexor carpi ulnaris fascia was divided. The intraarticular branch and the first branch to the SCU were transected; and then the nerve was transposed, it did not appear to have any significant tension or sharp turns. The fascial sling was made from the medial epicondyle and sewn to the subcutaneous tissues and the nerve had good translation with flexion and extension of the elbow and not too tight. The wound was irrigated. The tourniquet was deflated and the wound had excellent hemostasis. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with staples.

The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior cervical discectomy. A high incision was made to allow access to C2-C3. Skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma were divided sharply exposing the carotid sheath which was retracted laterally and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially. This exposed the vertebral bodies of C2-C3 and C4-C5 which was bridged by a plate. We placed in self-retaining retractors. With the tooth beneath the blades, the longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C2, C3, C4, and C5. After having done this, we used the all-purpose instrumentation to remove the instrumentation at C4-C5, we could see that fusion at C4-C5 was solid.,We next proceeded with the discectomy at C2-C3 and C3-C4 with disc removal. In a similar fashion using a curette to clean up the disc space and the space was fairly widened, as well as drilling up the vertebral joints using high-speed cutting followed by diamond drill bit. It was obvious that the C3-C4 neural foramina were almost totally obliterated due to the osteophytosis and foraminal stenosis. With the operating microscope; however, we had good visualization of these nerve roots, and we were able to ___________ both at C2-C3 and C3-C4. We then placed the ABC 55-mm plate from C2 down to C4. These were secured with 16-mm titanium screws after excellent purchase. We took an x-ray which showed excellent position of the plate, the screws, and the graft themselves. The next step was to irrigate the wound copiously with saline and bacitracin solution and s Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision. The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and Steri-Strips used to close the skin. Blood loss was about 50 mL. No complication of the surgery. Needle count, sponge count, cottonoid count was correct.,The operating microscope was used for the entirety for both visualization and magnification and illumination which was quite superb. At the time of surgery, he had total collapse of the C2, C3, and C4 disc with osteophyte formation. At both levels, he has high-grade spinal stenosis at these levels, especially foramen stenosis causing the compression, neck pain, headaches, and arm and shoulder pain.

The left ear laceration deformity was very close to the bottom of her ear and therefore it was transected through the centrifugal edge of the ear lobe and pared. The marsupialized epithelialized tracts were pared to raw tissue. They were pared in a fashion to create a Y-V plasty with de-epithelialization of the distal V and overlap of the undermined from the proximal cephalad edge. The 5-0 chromic sutures were used to approximate anteriorly, posteriorly, and anterior centrifugal edge in the Y-V plasty fashion to decrease the risk of notching. Bacitracin, Band-Aid was placed. Next, attention was turned to the contralateral ear where an elongated laceration deformity was pared of the marsupialized epithelialized edges anteriorly, posteriorly to create raw edges.

{"prompt": "Psychiatric Evaluation - 2, IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENT:, The patient is a 34-year-old Caucasian female.,CHIEF COMPLAINT:, Depression.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient's depression began in her teenage years. Sleep has been poor, for multiple reasons. She has obstructive sleep apnea, and has difficulties with a child who has insomnia related to medications that he takes. The patient tends to feel irritable, and has crying spells. She sometimes has problems with motivation. She has problems with memory, and energy level is poor. Appetite has been poor, but without weight change. Because of her frequent awakening, her CPAP machine monitor has indicated she is not using it enough, and Medicaid is threatening to refuse to pay for the machine. She does not have suicidal thoughts. ,The patient also has what she describes as going into a panic mode. During these times, she feels as if her whole body is going to explode. She has a hard time taking a deep breath, her heart rate goes up, blood pressure is measured as higher shortly afterward, and she gets a sense of impending doom. These spells may last a couple of hours, but once lasted for about two day. She does not get chest pain. These attacks tend to be precipitated by bills that cannot be paid, or being on a time crunch. ,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:, The patient's nurse practitioner had started her on Cymbalta, up to 60 mg per day. This was helpful, but then another physician switched her to Wellbutrin in the hope that this would help her quit smoking. Although she was able to cut down on tobacco usage, the depression has been more poorly controlled. She has used Wellbutrin up to 200 mg b.i.d. and Cymbalta up to 60 mg per day, at different times. At age 13, the patient cut her wrists because of issues with a boyfriend, and as she was being sutured she realized that this was a very stupid thing to do. She has never been hospitalized for psychiatric purposes. She did see a psychologist at age 16 briefly because of prior issues in her life, but she did not fully reveal information, and it was deemed that she did not need services. She has not previously spoken with a psychiatrist, but has been seeing a therapist, Stephanie Kitchen, at this facility.,SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:,Caffeine: The patient has two or three drinks per day of tea or Diet Pepsi.,Tobacco: She smokes about one pack of cigarettes per week since being on Wellbutrin, and prior to that time had been smoking one-half pack per day. She is still committed to quitting.,Alcohol: Denied.,Illicit drugs: Denied. In her earlier years, someone once put some unknown drug in her milk, and she came to when she was dancing on the table in front of the school nurse.,MEDICAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,Constitutional: See History of Present Illness.

These were representing on the order of 50% or more of the circumference of her lower leg. They were in a distribution to be consistent with stasis ulcers. They were granulating nicely and she was scheduled for surgery.,FINDINGS:, Large ulcers of lower extremities with size as described above. These are irregular in shape and posterior and laterally on the lower legs. There was no evidence of infection. The ultimate skin grafting was quite satisfactory.,PROCEDURE:, Having obtained adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped from the pubis to the toes. The legs were examined and the wounds were Pulsavaced bilaterally with 3 liters of saline with Bacitracin. The wounds were then inspected and there was adequate hemostasis and there was only minimal fibrinous debris that needed to be removed. Once this was accomplished, the skin was harvested from the right thigh at approximately 0.013 inch. This was meshed 1:1.5 and then stapled into position on the wounds. The wounds were then dressed with a fine mesh gauze that was stapled into position as well as Kerlix soaked in Sulfamylon solution.,She was then dressed in additional Kerlix, followed by Webril, and splints were fashioned in a spiral fashion that avoided foot drop and stabilized them, and at the same time did not put pressure across the heels. The donor site was dressed with Op-Site.

There is no significant angulation. The joint itself appears to be intact. The fracture line ends where it appears above the joint. I do not see any extra blood in the joint. I do not see any anterior or posterior Siegert sign.,I spoke with Dr. X. He suggests we go ahead and splint him up and he will follow the patient up. At this point, it does not seem like there needs to be any surgical revision. The chance of a compartment syndrome seems very low at this time.,Using 4-inch Ortho-Glass and two assistants, we applied a posterior splint to immobilize his fingers, hand, and wrist all the way up to his elbow to well above the elbow.,He had much better comfort once this was applied. There was good color to his fingers and again, much better comfort.,Once that was on, I took some 5-inch Ortho-Glass and put in extra reinforcement around the elbow so he would not be moving it, straightening it or breaking the fiberglass.,We then gave him a sling.,We gave him #2 Vicodin p.o. and #4 to go.

As you certainly know, he is now a 9-month-old male product of a twin gestation complicated by some very mild prematurity. He has been having problems with wheezing, cough and shortness of breath over the last several months. You and your partners have treated him aggressively with inhaled steroids and bronchodilator. Despite this, however; he has had persistent problems with a cough and has been more recently started on both a short burst of prednisolone as well as a more prolonged alternating day course. ,Although there is no smoke exposure there is a significant family history with both Abc's father and uncle having problems with asthma as well as his older sister. The parents now maintain separate households and there has been a question about the consistency of his medication administration at his father's house. ,On exam today, Abc had some scattered rhonchi which cleared with coughing but was otherwise healthy. ,We spent the majority of our 45-minute just reviewing basic principles of asthma management and I believe that Abc's mother is fairly well versed in this. I think the most important thing to realize is that Abc probably does have fairly severe childhood asthma and fortunately has avoided hospitalization. ,I think it would be prudent to continue his alternate day steroids until he is completely symptom free on the days off steroids but it would be reasonable to continue to wean him down to as low as 1.5 milligrams (0.5 milliliters on alternate days). I have encouraged his mother to contact our office so that we can answer questions if necessary by phone.,Thanks so much for allowing us to be involved in his care. ,Sincerely,letters, gestation, bronchodilator, childhood, childhood asthma, cough, father, healthy, letter, mother, pediatric, prematurity, shortness of breath, sister, wheezing, wheezing cough, asthma, \n\nLIST ALL TESTS: ", "completion": " None Found"}

Informed consent was obtained.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:, Slightly enlarged but otherwise normal-appearing uterus. Normal-appearing adnexa bilaterally.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, After administration of general anesthesia the patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Uterine manipulator was inserted as well as a Foley catheter and this was then draped off from the remainder of the abdominal field. A 5 mm incision was made umbilically after injecting 0.25% Marcaine; 0.25% Marcaine was injected in all the incisional sites. Veress needle was inserted, position confirmed using the saline drop method. After confirming an opening pressure of 4 mmHg of CO2 gas, approximately four liters was insufflated in the abdominal cavity. Veress needle was removed and a 5 mm port placed and position confirmed using the laparoscope. A 5 mm port was placed three fingerbreadths suprapubically and on the left and right side. All these were placed under direct visualization. Pelvic cavity was examined with findings as noted above. The left utero-ovarian ligament was grasped and cauterized using the Gyrus. Part of the superior aspect of the broad ligament was then cauterized as well. Following this the anterior peritoneum over the bladder flap was incised and the bladder flap bluntly resected off the lower uterine segment. The remainder of the broad and cardinal ligament was then cauterized and excised. A similar procedure was performed on the right side. The cardinal ligament was resected all the way down to 1 cm above the uterosacral ligament. After assuring that the bladder was well out of the way of the operative field, bipolar cautery was used to incise the cervix at a level just above the uterosacral ligaments. The area was irrigated extensively and cautery used to assure hemostasis. A 15 mm probe was then placed on the right side and the uterine morcellator was used to remove the specimen and submitted to pathology for examination. Hemostasis was again confirmed under low pressure. Using Carter-Thomason the fascia was closed in the 15 mm port site with 0 Vicryl suture. The accessory ports were removed and abdomen deflated and skin edges reapproximated with 5-0 Monocryl suture. Instruments removed from vagina. Patient returned to supine position, recalled from general anesthesia and transferred to recovery in satisfactory condition. Sponge and needle counts correct at the conclusion of the case.

As far as the afternoon, if she really wanted him to be on the medication, we will do a small dose of the Adderall, which she would prefer. So I have decided at this point to increase him to the Adderall XR 15 mg in the morning and then Adderall 5 mg in the afternoon. Mother is to watch his diet. We would like to recheck his weight if he is doing very well, in two months. But if there are any problems, especially in the morning then we would do the Ritalin LA.

{"prompt": "Delivery Note - 7, DELIVERY NOTE:, The patient is a 29-year-old gravida 6, para 2-1-2-3, who has had an estimated date of delivery at 01/05/2009. The patient presented to Labor and Delivery with complaints of spontaneous rupture of membranes at 2000 hours on 12/26/2008. She was found to be positive for Nitrazine pull and fern. At that time, she was not actually contracting. She was Group B Streptococcus positive, however, was 5 cm dilated. The patient was started on Group B Streptococcus prophylaxis with ampicillin. She received a total of three doses throughout her labor. Her pregnancy was complicated by scanty prenatal care. She would frequently miss visits. At 37 weeks, she claims that she had a suspicious bump on her left labia. There was apparently no fluid or blistering of the lesion. Therefore, it was not cultured by the provider; however, the patient was sent for serum HSV antibody levels, which she tested positive for both HSV1 and HSV2. I performed a bright light exam and found no lesions anywhere on the vulva or in the vault as per sterile speculum exam and consulted with Dr. X, who agreed that since the patient seems to have no active lesion that she likely has had a primary outbreak in the past and it is safe to proceed with the vaginal delivery. The patient requested an epidural anesthetic, which she received with very good relief. She had IV Pitocin augmentation of labor and became completely dilated per my just routine exam just after 6 o'clock and was set up for delivery and the patient pushed very effectively for about one and a half contractions. She delivered a viable female infant on 12/27/2008 at 0626 hours delivering over an intact perineum. The baby delivered in the occiput anterior position. The baby was delivered to the mother's abdomen where she was warm, dry, and stimulated. The umbilical cord was doubly clamped and then cut. The baby's Apgars were 8 and 9. The placenta was delivered spontaneously intact. There was a three-vessel cord with normal insertion. The fundus was massaged to firm and Pitocin was administered through the IV per unit protocol. The perineum was inspected and was found to be fully intact. Estimated blood loss was approximately 400 mL. The patient's blood type is A+. She is rubella immune and as previously mentioned, GBS positive and she received three doses of ampicillin.surgery, nitrazine pull and fern, rupture of membranes, spontaneous, membranes, nitrazine, streptococcus, pitocin, perineum, hsv, laborNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

{"prompt": "Laparoscopy & Salpingo-oophorectomy, PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Left adnexal mass.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Left ovarian lesion.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: ,Laparoscopy with left salpingo-oophorectomy.,ANESTHESIA:, General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:, Less than 50 cc.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,FINDINGS:, The labia and perineum were within normal limits. The hymen was found to be intact. Laparoscopic findings revealed a 4 cm left adnexal mass, which appeared fluid filled. There were a few calcifications on the surface of the mass. The right ovary and fallopian tube appeared normal. There was no evidence of endometriosis. The uterus appeared normal in size. There were no pelvic adhesions noted.,INDICATIONS:, The patient is a 55-year-old gravida 0, para 0 Caucasian female who presents with a left adnexal mass on ultrasound which is 5.3 cm. She does complain of minimal discomfort. Bimanual exam was not able to be performed secondary to the vaginal stenosis and completely intact hymen.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the Operative Suite, prepped and draped, and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. A 1 cm skin incision was made in the infraumbilical vault. While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty and the abdomen was insufflated. This was done using appropriate flow and volume of CO2. The #11 step trocar was then placed without difficulty. The above findings were confirmed. A #12 mm port was then placed approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis under direct visualization. Two additional ports were placed, one on the left lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and one on the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall. Both #12 step ports were done under direct visualization. Using a grasper, the mass was tented up at the inferior pelvic ligament and the LigaSure was placed across this and several bites were taken with good visualization while ligating. The left ovary was then placed in an Endocatch bag and removed through the suprapubic incision. The skin was extended around this incision and the fascia was extended using the Mayo scissors. The specimen was removed intact in the Endocatch bag through this site. Prior to desufflation of the abdomen, the site where the left adnexa was removed was visualized to be hemostatic. All the port sites were hemostatic as well. The fascia of the suprapubic incision was then repaired using a running #0 Vicryl stitch on a UR6 needle. The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The remaining incisions were also closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running fashion after all instruments were removed and the abdomen was completely desufflated. Steri-Strips were placed on each of the incisions. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Sponge, lap, and needle count were x2. She will go home on Vicodin for pain and followup postoperatively in the office where we will review path report with her.surgery, salpingo-oophorectomy, ovarian lesion, adnexal mass, salpingo oophorectomy, abdominal wall, intact, adnexal, laparoscopy, mass, \n\nLIST ALL TESTS: ", "completion": " The patient will go home on Vicodin for pain and followup postoperatively in the office where we will review path report with her."}
